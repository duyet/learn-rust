# Learning Rust

**Why Rust?**

- I enjoy working with distributed systems, high performance web and frontend technologies.
- I'm try to learn new programming language.
- Rust seems to be a potential programming language for a Data Engineer: build a Data Platform, API Backend, WebAssembly Frontend, build SDK to collect logs, ...

I will only note something new or weird about Rust by a Python-er or Typescript-er.

# Let's get started

- [Day 1: Basic about cargo, variable, mut, fn, data types](day1)
- [Day 2: Control flows (if/else, match, loop, for), vectors](day2)
- [Day 3: Some Leetcode: two_sum, palindrome](day3): Try to learn learn struct, Linked List, Optional, Box, etc in Rust via solving Leetcode.
